% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
Given raw TV broadcasts, each shot must be automatically tagged with the name(s) of people who can be both seen as well as heard in the shot. The list of people is not known a priori and their names must be discovered in an unsupervised way from provided text overlay or speech transcripts. The task will be evaluated on a new French corpus (provided by INA), using standard information retrieval metrics based on a posteriori collaborative annotation of the corpus.

\section{Motivation}

TV archives maintained by national institutions such as the French INA, the Netherlands Institute for Sound \& Vision, or the BBC are rapidly growing in size. The need for applications that make these archives searchable has led researchers to devote concerted effort to developing technologies that create indexes.

Indexes that represent the location and identity of people in the archive are indispensable for searching archives. Human nature leads people to be very interested in other people. However, at the moment that content is created or broadcast, it is not always possible to predict which people will be the most important to find in the future. Someone who appeared in a broadcast, but was relatively unnoticed, might suddenly start generating a buzz and become a trending topic on social networks or search engines. For this reason, it is not possible to assume that a biometric models capable of detecting an individual, will be present at indexing time. For some people such a model may not be available in advance, simply because they are not (yet) famous. In such cases, it is also possible that archivists annotating content by hand do not even know the name of the person. The goal of this task is to address the challenge of indexing people in the archive, under real-world conditions (i.e., there is no pre-set list of people to index). 

This task represents an extension of the (now completed) French REPERE challenge, which focused on multimodal person recognition in TV broadcast. The main objective of this challenge was to answer the two questions "Who speaks when?" and "Who appears when?" using any sources of information (including pre-existing biometric models and person names extracted from text overlay and speech transcripts). In this new task, only unsupervised algorithms (i.e., algorithms not relying on pre-existing labels or biometric models) are admitted. To ensure high quality indexes, those algorithms should also help human annotators double-check these indexes by providing an evidence of the claimed identity (especially for people who are not yet famous).

\section{Goal of the task}

Given raw TV broadcasts, each shot must be automatically tagged with the name(s) of people who can be both seen as well as heard in the shot. The list of people is not known a priori and their names must be discovered in an unsupervised way from provided text overlay or speech transcripts. 

Participants are provided with a collection of TV broadcasts pre-segmented into shots, along with the output of several baseline components: speaker diarization, face detection and tracking, speech transcription, video OCR and named entity detection. 

Participants are asked to provide, for each shot, the list of names of persons speaking AND appearing at the same time. The main novelty of the task is that the list of persons is not provided a priori, and person models (neither voice nor face) may not be trained on external data. The only way to identify a person is by finding their name in the audio (e.g., using speech transcription) or visual (e.g., using optical character recognition) streams and associating them to the correct person making the task completely unsupervised. For each returned shot, participants are also asked to provide the evidence justifying their assertion (e.g. a short excerpt of the test set showing the person AND its name at the same time).

\section{The data set}

The original REPERE corpus set will be used as development set. This corpus is composed of various TV shows (focusing on news, politics and people) from two French TV channels. It will be distributed by ELDA (Evaluation and Language resources Distribution Agency) freely or at distribution cost. Among those 137 hours, 50 are already manually annotated. Audio annotations are dense and provide speech transcripts and identity-labeled speech turns. Video annotations are sparse (one image every 10 seconds) and provide overlaid text transcripts and identity-labeled face segmentation. Both speech and overlaid text transcripts are tagged with named entities.

The test set is composed of French TV news corpus provided by INA. This corpus contains 106 hours of video, corresponding to 172 editions of evening broadcast news "Le 20 heures" of French public channel "France 2", from January 1st 2007 to June 30st 2007.

These videos are segmented automatically into shots. Only shots that are longer than 2 seconds are consider for the annotation and the evaluation.

\end{itemize}

For name sources: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Video OCR for written names in a title box
\item Speech transcription and named entities detection
\end{itemize}

Fusion system baseline: late naming

\begin{enumerate}
\item Propagation of written names onto speaker cluster. 
\item Propagation of speaker identities to the face with the higher probability to be the speaker
\end{enumerate}

Fusion Limsi system: constraint clustering

In \cite{}, we present an audio-video diarization process that used overlaid names to both names clusters and also constrain the clustering to prevent the fusion of clusters associated to different overlaid names.





\section{Ground truth}

Groundtruth will be created a posteriori by manually checking all the evidences proposed by participant. From correct evidences we can extract a mugshot that can help us for the second step, the manual annotation of speaking faces in selected shots.

\subsubsection{Evidence}

In this first step (see figure \ref{fig:evidence}), we ask to the annotator to check if the person correspond to the evidence is visible in the shot and has his name written on screen during the shot or pronounced by a speaker (shot +- 5 seconds). If this is the case, the annotator draw a bounding box around the same to create a mugshot for this person.

 \center 
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figs/evidence_interface.png}
 \centering
 \caption {Web annotation interface of evidences.}
 \label{fig:evidence}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{label}

In the second step, for each shot (at the left in the figure \ref{fig:label}), we used all the submissions of participants to build a set of hypothesis person names (the mugshot at the right in the figure \ref{fig:label}). We ask to the annotator to move these mug shot to the right position (don't know, no visible, silent face, speaking face). At the bottom, we also proposed some mugshots proposed or already annotated in the near shot. A search field can be used to find a person if it is not proposed. A figure with a question mark symbolize that a speaking face is visible but the annotator don't known who is it.

 \center 
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figs/label_interface.png}
 \centering
 \caption {Web annotation interface of labels.}
 \label{fig:label}
\end{figure}



\section{Evaluation procedure}

This procedure results in an Average Precision specific to the query and to the video. In order to prevent giving too much weight to predominant people or to individual video, we will first compute the Mean Average Precision over all videos where a particular person is detected, and then compute a Mean Mean Average Precision over all persons.

Average Precision will be modified slightly to take the quality of the evidence into account. Hence, instead of a binary judgment (relevant vs. not relevant), shot relevance will be computed as follows (the value of α will be discussed during the development phase):

{shot relevance} = α . {shot is relevant} + (1 - α) . {evidence is correct}
